# SCRIPTING-AND-AUTOMATION

1.  ##Understanding the basic file navigation systems##
File system navigation (cd, ls, pwd)

File operations (cp, mv, rm, touch, cat)

Permissions (chmod, chown)

Process management (ps, top, kill)

Networking (ping, curl, netstat)

Redirection and pipes (>, >>, |, <)

2. Command substitution takes the output of a command and stores it inside a variable

3. Shebang (#!): The first line of a script, e.g., #!/bin/bash, specifies the interpreter to use for executing the script.
